## Usage

After installation, you can start using ContextASR-Bench. Hereâ€™s how:

1. Prepare your dataset according to the guidelines provided in the documentation.
2. Run the evaluation script:
   ```bash
   python evaluate.py --dataset your_dataset_path
   ```

3. Analyze the results generated by the tool.

For specific usage examples and advanced features, check the documentation.

## Datasets

ContextASR-Bench includes several datasets designed for contextual speech recognition tasks. Here are some of the key datasets:

- **Dataset A**: Focuses on conversational speech in various contexts.
- **Dataset B**: Contains formal speech samples, ideal for testing recognition accuracy.
- **Dataset C**: A mix of informal and formal speech, providing a balanced evaluation.

Each dataset is structured to facilitate easy access and processing. Refer to the documentation for details on how to download and use these datasets.

## Evaluation Metrics

To assess the performance of your speech recognition models, ContextASR-Bench provides several evaluation metrics:

- **Word Error Rate (WER)**: Measures the number of errors in recognized words.
- **Character Error Rate (CER)**: Evaluates the accuracy at the character level.
- **Real-time Factor (RTF)**: Assesses the processing speed of the model.

These metrics will help you understand the strengths and weaknesses of your models.
